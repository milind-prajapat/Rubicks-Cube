# Rubik's-Cube 
Rubik's Cube Solving Algorithm
This project is a Rubic's cube solver that can read the cube's state and perform actions to solve it.

The actions are visualized using an online simulator( google cube).

## Instructions to use
You can then either run the code directly on the visual studio using [Rubicks Cube.sln](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Rubiks-Cube/blob/Algorithm/Rubicks%20Cube.sln) or can run [Rubicks_Cube.py](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Rubiks-Cube/blob/Algorithm/Rubicks_Cube.py).

## Features
* Image processing helps to fetch the initial state of the cube.
* The code controls the Keyboard keys, further influencing the simulator through which every step is visualized.
* The Algorithm uses the beginner's method.
